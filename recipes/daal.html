<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Daal is a soup with lentils as its main ingredient; </p>
<p>it may be vegetarian or include meat, and may use brown, red, yellow, green or black lentils, with or without the husk. </p>
<p>Dehulled yellow and red lentils disintegrate in cooking, making a thick soup. It is a staple food throughout Europe, Latin America and the Middle East.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>coconut oil</li>
<li>onions</li>
<li>garlic</li> 
<li>ginger</li>
<li>turmeric</li>
<li>coriander</li>
<li>cumin</li> 
<li>garam masala</li>
<li>red lentils</li>
<li>vegetable broth</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Heat the coconut oil in a skillet or saucepan. Add the chopped onions, and sauté for 2-3 minutes until translucent. Then add the garlic and ginger sauté for another minute until fragrant. Lastly, add the spices, and sauté for a few seconds to unfold flavors.
</li>
<li>Place the lentils in a fine-mashed sieve and rinse until cold running water. Then add them to the onion mixture in the skillet. Pour in the vegetable broth, stir to combine, and bring to a simmer. Cook covered for 8-10 minutes, or until the lentils have absorbed most of the liquid.
</li> 
<li>Add the coconut milk and strained tomatoes (if using) and simmer another 5-10 minutes, or until the lentils are tender. (If the sauce is too thick, add a little more broth or coconut milk, until the desired consistency is reached). Season with salt, pepper, coconut sugar, and lime juice to taste.
